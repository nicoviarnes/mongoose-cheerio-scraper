### RateBeer Top 50 Scraper

The backend uses cheerio to scrape data from https://www.ratebeer.com/top, then uses mongoose to convert the scraped data into mongo documents. The front end renders the mongo documents in a bootstrap table. The user can add notes to any beers on the list and they will be seen by other users of the app.
